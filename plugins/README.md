## Usage:   
   
> First, create an instance of the ItemManager core (It should be called at least once in your code): 
   
```php
$imanager = imanager();
```
   
Here's an example, should you want to save your data in order to be able
to use it again later on, just do this:
   
```php
$item = new Item(1);
$item->name = 'My item name';
$item->setFieldValue('data', 'Hello world');
$item->save();
```
   
In order to bring the data into display again do this:
   
```php
$item = imanager()->getItem(1, 'name=My item name');
echo $item->fields->data->value; // Outputs: Hello world
```

## Installation Instructions:   
   
**Installing ItemManager 2.+ from the ZIP file:**   
You can download the current version of the ItemManager on GitHub. Unzip the downloaded file and copy its
contents to your plugins folder. The required data directories and configurations should be created automatically
when you first access the plugin. Make sure that PHP-process has enough security permissions to access these files.
   
**Upgrading ItemManager 2.+ from the ZIP file:**   
ItemManager upgrades are easy because everything important to your site is contained under the `/data/imanager/` and
`/data/uploads/imanager/` directory. You should delete everything else in `/plugins/` directory that belongs to the
ItemManager and leave the both directories above as it is.
   
**Upgrading ItemManager 2.+ to 2.3.+:**   
Download the latest version of ItemManager GitHub     
Extract the ZIP file somewhere temporary.   
Delete the following file from your `/plugins/` directory:     
   
Delete: `/plugins/imanager` folder   
Delete: `/plugins/imanager.php` file   
Upload the new version imanager folder to `/plugins/` directory   
Upload the new version `imanager.php` to `/plugins/` directory

## Latest Changes V2.4.5:
**:::New features**   
- This version adds new methods to format the output of the Money field [#10](https://github.com/bigin/ItemManager_2.0/issues/10).
- A custom config file can now be used: The IM can run with different configuration options without having to exchange 
the default `config.php`. To accomplish this, just copy an existing `config.php` file from `/plugins/imanager/lib/inc/` 
to your `/data/imanager/settings/` directory and modify the relevant variables in it.    
- Minimal CSS adjustment for the rendering of fields in the admin.    

**:::Bug fixes**   
- Money field error `Invalid value format for the Fieldtype NAME` has been fixed [#10](https://github.com/bigin/ItemManager_2.0/issues/10).   
- Type assignment for the config variables `thumbwidth` and `thumbheight` has been corrected.
